# Delivery Fee Calculator
The goal of the assignment is to showcase your coding skills and ability to develop features. We DON'T expect you to build production quality code. This is a highly important part of the hiring process so it's crucial to put effort into this without making it too bloated. Reviewers will put weight on three main aspects: code quality, maintainability, and testing. Based on the results of the assignment review, we will make the decision on proceeding to the technical interview.

Your task is to write a delivery fee calculator. This code is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and we’d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the number of items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance.

# Specification
Rules for calculating a delivery fee

If the cart value is less than 10€, a small order surcharge is added to the delivery price. The surcharge is the difference between the cart value and 10€. For example if the cart value is 8.90€, the surcharge will be 1.10€.
A delivery fee for the first 1000 meters (=1km) is 2€. If the delivery distance is longer than that, 1€ is added for every additional 500 meters that the courier needs to travel before reaching the destination. Even if the distance would be shorter than 500 meters, the minimum fee is always 1€.
Example 1: If the delivery distance is 1499 meters, the delivery fee is: 2€ base fee + 1€ for the additional 500 m => 3€
Example 2: If the delivery distance is 1500 meters, the delivery fee is: 2€ base fee + 1€ for the additional 500 m => 3€
Example 3: If the delivery distance is 1501 meters, the delivery fee is: 2€ base fee + 1€ for the first 500 m + 1€ for the second 500 m => 4€
If the number of items is five or more, an additional 50 cent surcharge is added for each item above and including the fifth item. An extra "bulk" fee applies for more than 12 items of 1,20€
Example 1: If the number of items is 4, no extra surcharge
Example 2: If the number of items is 5, 50 cents surcharge is added
Example 3: If the number of items is 10, 3€ surcharge (6 x 50 cents) is added
Example 4: If the number of items is 13, 5,70€ surcharge is added ((9 * 50 cents) + 1,20€)
The delivery fee can never be more than 15€, including possible surcharges.
The delivery is free (0€) when the cart value is equal or more than 100€.
During the Friday rush (3 - 7 PM UTC), the delivery fee (the total fee including possible surcharges) will be multiplied by 1.2x. However, the fee still cannot be more than the max (15€).
